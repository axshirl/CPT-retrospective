#### Package Loads ####
package_list = c("dplyr", "tidyr", "jsonlite", 'purrr')
packages_missing = package_list[!(package_list %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(packages_missing) > 0) install.packages(packages_missing)
loaded_pkgs = lapply(package_list, require, character.only = TRUE)

####Reading in json files####
tournaments_json <- fromJSON("data/tournaments.json") %>%
  as.data.frame()

#turn json into tournament level- each record is a tournament tibble-
#have a column that is a list column of player involved, characters, placements
#function takes in a nested structure

#date read in as character
sfv_tourneys <- tournaments_json %>% 
  filter(version == 'SF5') %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))

#need a way to gather a list of placements by character. 
#Or even just setup average placement by character? mean and median?
#group_by(pteams) %>% summarize(mean(place), median(place))
#Big problem tho- We want to summarize these for ALL tournaments, we can't average them per tourney.
#could unnest the players column then group & summarize. But I don't know if I like that... doesnt feel tidy.
