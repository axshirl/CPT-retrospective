#### Package Loads ####
package_list = c("dplyr", "tidyr", "jsonlite", 'purrr')
packages_missing = package_list[!(package_list %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(packages_missing) > 0) install.packages(packages_missing)
loaded_pkgs = lapply(package_list, require, character.only = TRUE)

####Reading in json files####
tournaments_json <- fromJSON("data/tournaments.json") %>%
  as.data.frame()

#turn json into tournament level- each record is a tournament tibble-
#have a column that is a list column of player involved, characters, placements
#function takes in a nested structure

#date read in as character
sfv_tourneys <- tournaments_json %>% 
  filter(version == 'SF5') %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = '%d-%m-%Y')) #%>%
  #unnest(players)

unique(sfv_tourneys$type)
#data before a certain date (2019? very recent) is entirely listed as UNRANKED for column 'type'
#most likely going to have to go thru ranking criteria for 2016 -> 2019 seasons & 
#manually add points by ranking type. shouldn't be THAT bad since once I 
#correctly classify each type of tourney I can just then score by Place + Tourney Type w/ ifelse
